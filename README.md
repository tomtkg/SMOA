# SMOA
Supervised Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm

## How to use
SMOA.m is main file. You can execute SMOA.m like 
```MATLAB
matlab -batch "SMOA"
```

The same code is also implemented in PlatEMO.
It is located at [https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO/tree/master/PlatEMO/Algorithms/Multi-objective%20optimization/SMOA](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO/tree/master/PlatEMO/Algorithms/Multi-objective%20optimization/SMOA).
